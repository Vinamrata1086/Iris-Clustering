# Iris-Clustering

## Prediction using Unsupervised Learning

## K-Means Clustering Analysis on Iris Dataset

Iris flower data set was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Iris data set gives the measurements in centimetres of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Objective

The Objective is to segment the iris data(without labels) into clusters — 1, 2 & 3 by k-means clustering & compare these clusters with the actual species clusters — setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
